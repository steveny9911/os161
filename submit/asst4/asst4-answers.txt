1. The ELF magic numbers are offsets for the 1-byte fields within e_ident.
They are EI_MAG0, EI_MAG1, EI_MAG2A and EI_MAG3.

2. The difference between UIO_USERISPACE and UIO_USERSPACE is that 
UIO_USERISPACE contains user process code and UIO_USERSPACE contains user
process data. One should use UIO_SYSSPACE instead when source or destination
of data transfer is in the kernel space.

3. The struct uio is allocated on the stack in load_segment because the 
adress space of memory is stored in uio_space in the struct uio.

4. It is important to call vfs_close() because it calls VOP_DECREF, which
decrements the reference count of the vnode.

5. The function forces the processor to switch into usermode is mips_usermode.
This function is not machine dependent.

6. Copyin and Copyout are defined in copyinout.c. Memmove is defined in 
memmove.c. Copyin and copyout can't be implemented as simply as memmove 
because copyin and copyout ensure the copied user pointers are valid.

7. The purpose of userptr_t is to point to a one-byte struct.

8. The numerical value of the exception code for a MIPS system call is 8.

9. The number of bytes in an instruction in MIPS is 4 bytes.

10. I "probably want to change" the implementation of kill_curthread() 
because I don't want kernel to panic when user-level code hits a fatal fault.

11. To implement a system call that took more than 4 arguments, user-level
stack would be required.

12. The purpose of the SYSCALL macro is to load the syscall number into v0
and jump to the shared syscall code.

13. The MIPS instruction that actually triggers a system call is syscall.

14. The first argument can be found in a0, the second argument can be found
in a2/a3 and the third argument can be found in the user-level stack. The
64-bit offset is returned in v0 and v1.

15. To open a file, vfs_open is called. To read a file, O_RDONLY is called;
to write a file, O_WRONLY is called. To represent an open file, vnode is 
used.

16. The purpose of VOP_INCREF and VOP_DECREF is to increment and decrement
refcount.
